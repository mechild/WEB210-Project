		<h1>Micky Child</h1>
		<h2>Graphic Design Student</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Micky and I am a graphic design and advertising student. I am currently attending Wake Technical Community College. I have experience with working with both HTML5 and CSS. Currently I am working on improving my knowledge of both HTML5 and CSS to work on making better more intereactive and accessible websites that can help people around the world understand more about LGBT+ issues. But to reach that goal I have to continue to work on coding, retaining knowledge of how different CSS elements interact with the content and vision I have for a website or webpage. I am open to continuing  to learn and receiving feedback for what I create and hope learn more in the next coming years.</p>

	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <h3>Website developer</h3>
  <p>Viscous Cycle</p>
		<p>Spring 2018</p>
	<p>I was tasked with creating a website for the company Viscous Cycle, a local bicycle company, in order to help them connect with their community and let locals know they were out there. It was also important to the company that the site was created in such a way that it was easy to access for anyone who may be looking for repair or purchasing services.</p>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<h3>Wake Technical Community College, Attending currently,2018-2021</h3>
		<p>I am a student so I am still working on my degree</p>
		<p>The knowledge I have gained from my instructors has been key to my success as a web/graphic designer. The feedback I am given is also very helpful as it allows me to continue to progress and grow while also not overstepping areas where I have made mistakes. The learning environment amongst my peers has also been valuable as we also work on helping each other understand and improve.  </p>
